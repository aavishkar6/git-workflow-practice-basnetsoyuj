## [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)

This [article](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) introduces a fascinating perspective on the developing landscape of software engineering, referring to the use of neural networks as _"Software 2.0"_.

I found interesting the analogy of Software 1.0 as a traditional coding process and Software 2.0 as a machine learning centered optimized system. In the conventional Software 1.0 approach, programmers craft explicit instructions for computers to follow. However, in the Software 2.0 approach, neural networks are used to perform the learning from data and execute tasks surpassing human precision in several domains.

The adoption of Software 2.0 has been driven by the growing complexity of problems that are more easily addressed through data collection rather than explicit programming. This is further aided by Software 2.0's advantages such as computational homogeneity, leading to constant running time and memory usage.

However, I also appreciated the balanced view offered in this piece. The author does not shy away from discussing the limitations of the Software 2.0 stack, a crucial point being the 'black box' nature of these networks, which presents a big challenge in terms of accountability and debugging.

Overall, this article drives home the exciting future of machine learning, pushing us to contemplate future programming and software paradigms. As a computer science student, it reinforces the ever-evolving nature of technological fields and the need for constant learning and adaptation. It leaves me pondering the future of software engineering.
